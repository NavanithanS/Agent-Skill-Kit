triggers: ["brainstorm this", "have an idea", "figure out requirements", "explore options"]

<critical_constraints>
❌ NO implementation before brainstorming
✅ MUST clarify user intent and success criteria
✅ MUST get explicit confirmation before proceeding
✅ MUST explore multiple approaches with pros/cons
</critical_constraints>

<process>
1. **Understand Intent**: What are they trying to achieve? Why now? What's success?
2. **Gather Requirements**: Functional (what it does) + Non-functional (performance, constraints)
3. **Explore Options**: Multiple approaches, pros/cons, edge cases
4. **Confirm Alignment**: Summarize direction, get explicit approval
</process>

<output>
Clear, agreed-upon plan or design decisions that guide implementation.
</output>

<when_to_use>
- Before new feature or component
- Before significant behavior modification
- When requirements are vague
- When multiple valid approaches exist
</when_to_use>
