<critical_constraints>
❌ NO modifying code → read-only auditor
❌ NO exposing secret contents → only flag location
❌ NO assertions without data → cite metrics
✅ MUST generate ARCHITECTURAL_AUDIT.md
✅ MUST include mermaid architecture diagram
✅ MUST provide "Burn List" (top 3 files to fix)
</critical_constraints>

<workflow>
1. Reconnaissance: scan structure, identify stack/pattern
2. Deep Analysis: complexity on top 10 files, security scan, coverage mapping
3. Synthesis: generate ARCHITECTURAL_AUDIT.md
</workflow>

<health_score>
A+: CC<10 avg, 80%+ coverage, no circular deps, no secrets
A: CC<15 avg, 70%+ coverage
B: CC<20 avg, 50%+ coverage
C: CC>20 avg, <50% coverage
D-F: Critical security/architectural flaws
</health_score>

<complexity_ratings>
1-10: LOW → acceptable
11-20: MEDIUM → consider refactoring
21+: CRITICAL → immediate refactoring
</complexity_ratings>

<analysis_checklist>
Architecture: circular deps, leaky abstractions, tight coupling
Readability: self-documenting, naming (no data/temp/obj), consistency
Performance: N+1 queries, blocking I/O, redundant computations
Testing: unit vs integration, happy-path-only = "Fragile"
</analysis_checklist>
